 You can use cURL to try the authentication process in two steps: get a token, and send the token to a service.

Get an authentication token by providing your user name and either your API key or your password. Here are examples of both approaches:

You can request a token by providing your user name and your password.


Successful authentication returns a token which you can use as evidence that your identity has already been authenticated. To use the token, pass it to other services as an X-Auth-Token header.

Authentication also returns a service catalog, listing the endpoints you can use for Cloud services.

Use the authentication token to send a GET to a service you would like to use.

Authentication tokens are typically valid for 24 hours. Applications should be designed to re-authenticate after receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response from a service endpoint.
